# frontend/src/pages/

Page-level architecture: the Quests hub, the Atlas hub, the Sigil Frontispiece, the Yearbook, the role-split Dashboard, and the page primitives that unify how every page renders.

## Page primitives (added 2026-05, commit `2b240fc`)

The 2026-05 audit lifted two layout primitives out of the per-page copy-paste pattern:

- **`<PageShell>`** ([`components/layout/PageShell.jsx`](/frontend/src/components/layout/PageShell.jsx)) — root wrapper replacing the copy-pasted `<motion.div className="max-w-6xl mx-auto space-y-5">`. Owns spine width (`max-w-6xl` wide / `max-w-3xl` narrow), vertical rhythm (3 tiers: `loose` = `space-y-6`, `default` = `space-y-5`, `tight` = `space-y-3`), and the fade-in animation. Does NOT add horizontal padding (that stays in `JournalShell`'s `px-4 md:px-6` to avoid double-padding). Set `animate={false}` for pages handling their own motion; pass `variants` to take over the motion config entirely. Set `as="main"` for `<main>` semantics. Used today across 19 pages — Achievements, Badges, ChildDashboard, Chores, ClockPage, Habits, Inventory, Manage, ParentDashboard, Payments, ProjectNew, Projects, Rewards, SettingsPage, Timecards, Trials, and JournalEntryFormModal.

- **`<SectionHeader>`** ([`components/SectionHeader.jsx`](/frontend/src/components/SectionHeader.jsx)) — non-collapsible sibling of `AccordionSection` for always-open sections. Mirrors the `AccordionSection` vocabulary: script kicker, atlas chapter numeral via `index` prop (renders `§I`, `§II`, … through `chapterMark`), `RuneBadge` count badge, optional supporting body line via children, and right-aligned `actions` slot. Renders as `h2` by default (configurable via `as` prop — use `h3` for nested). Extensively used in `SettingsPage`, which now reads as a journal chapter with six `ParchmentCard` sections each led by a `SectionHeader` with chapter numerals 0-5.

**Mobile readability**: as part of the same audit:
- `HeaderStatusPips` button heights bumped from `h-8` (32px) → `h-11` (44px) with `px-3` to meet mobile tap-target sizing; text changed from `text-xs` → `text-caption`.
- Form modal grids now collapse `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2` (or `sm:grid-cols-3`) for screens below 640px (Chores, Habits, Manage, Timecards, Trials).
- All raw `text-xs` and `text-sm` replaced with semantic tokens (`text-caption`, `text-body`, `text-tiny`, `text-lede`) across ~110 instances.
- 30+ raw `<button>` elements migrated to `<Button>` or `<IconButton>` primitives across Habits, Chores, Settings, Manage, Inventory, Payments, Trials, ProjectNew, ClockPage, Rewards, Projects, Achievements, and Badges.

## Quests hub (commits `3e8c18c`, `69d7b48`)

The Quests page consolidates all "things to do" under one tab hub. Six top-level `ChapterHub` tabs:

| Tab | Slug | Backing page |
|---|---|---|
| Ventures | `ventures` | `pages/Projects.jsx` |
| Duties | `duties` | `pages/Chores.jsx` |
| Study | `study` | `pages/Homework/index.jsx` |
| Rituals | `rituals` | `pages/Habits.jsx` |
| Movement | `movement` | `pages/Movement.jsx` |
| Trials | `trials` | `pages/trials/index.jsx` |

The hub itself lives at [`pages/quests/index.jsx`](/frontend/src/pages/quests/index.jsx). Legacy routes redirect:
- `/chores` → `/quests?tab=duties`
- `/homework` → `/quests?tab=study`
- `/habits` → `/quests?tab=rituals`
- `/trials` → `/quests?tab=trials` via `TrialsLegacyRedirect()` in [`App.jsx`](/frontend/src/App.jsx) (preserves the search string so `/trials?scroll=<itemId>` from QuickActions still works).

### Shared folio shell

[`pages/quests/QuestFolio.jsx`](/frontend/src/pages/quests/QuestFolio.jsx) is the verso/recto shell shared by Ventures, Duties, Study, Rituals, Movement. Modeled on `pages/achievements/FolioSpread.jsx` but parameterized so a tab can fill in its own letter / title / stats / progress without dragging the skill-tree XP math along.
- **Verso** (left, ~220-260px desktop · top banner mobile): cloth headband tied to tier (`tierForProgress`), brass-rimmed `IlluminatedVersal` drop-cap, script kicker, display-serif title with foil-glint, stats row, progress bar, optional `RarityStrand`.
- **Recto** (right): consumer-supplied children — the working list grouped under `ChapterRubric` numerals (§I, §II, …).

No new tier ladders, halo colors, or keyframes — composition against the existing Atlas cohort.

### Rarity mapping

[`pages/quests/quests.constants.js`](/frontend/src/pages/quests/quests.constants.js) maps per-page tier concepts onto the Atlas `RARITY_KEYS` vocabulary:
- `difficultyToRarity(level)` — Project difficulty 1-5 → common / uncommon / rare / epic / legendary (clamped both ends so off-scale values land on common).
- `effortToRarity` — Homework effort_level uses the same 1-5 ladder; aliased to `difficultyToRarity`.
- `buildRarityCounts(items, mapper, isEarned)` — produces the `{common: {earned, total}, …, legendary: {…}}` shape `RarityStrand` consumes. Empty buckets stay at 0 so the trough still paints.

Ventures + Study render a `RarityStrand` on the verso. Duties, Rituals, Movement, Trials skip it (their progression isn't difficulty-ranked).

### Trials sub-architecture

The standalone `/trials` page was folded into the Quests hub as tab #6 and rewritten to speak the codex/folio/vessels vocabulary. Files under [`pages/trials/`](/frontend/src/pages/trials/):
- `index.jsx` — orchestrator: `IncipitBand` hero → `IssueChallengeForm` (parent-only) → `ActiveQuestFolio` → `FamilyTrialsFolio` → `QuestCodex`.
- `ActiveQuestFolio.jsx` — wraps the in-progress quest in the shared `QuestFolio` verso/recto shell (letter initial, quest name, progress, stats, party/rewards on the recto).
- `QuestCodex.jsx` — vessel kind shelf (All/Boss/Collection/Co-op) + codex shelf (four status chapters: **Available** §I / **Underway** §II / **Closed** §III / **Locked** §IV) + `TrialsFolio` body. The Locked chapter is new — quests gated by `required_badge` render there with an unlock hint.
- `TrialsFolio.jsx` — chapter body; tile grid of `QuestTile` components.
- `QuestTile.jsx` — individual quest card.
- `FamilyTrialsFolio.jsx` — parent's family roll-up with `ChapterRubric` header.
- `IssueChallengeForm.jsx` — parent-only utilitarian form; co-op toggle + multi-child picker; surfaces `allowed_triggers` and `on_time_only` toggle in an Advanced details panel.
- `trials.constants.js` — `CHAPTERS`, `KIND_FILTERS`, `groupQuestsByChapter`, `overallProgress`, status & kind vocabulary.

Backend `QuestDefinitionSerializer` widened by two fields — `required_badge_id` + `required_badge_name` — so the Locked chapter can render unlock hints without a second fetch.

## Atlas hub ([`pages/atlas/index.jsx`](/frontend/src/pages/atlas/index.jsx))

Three top-level `ChapterHub` tabs — **Skills** ([`pages/Achievements.jsx`](/frontend/src/pages/Achievements.jsx)), **Badges** ([`pages/Badges.jsx`](/frontend/src/pages/Badges.jsx)), **Sketchbook** ([`pages/Portfolio.jsx`](/frontend/src/pages/Portfolio.jsx)). Skills and Badges are siblings, not sub-tabs. Badge admin (create/edit/delete) lives under Skills → Manage because [`ManagePanel`](/frontend/src/pages/achievements/ManagePanel.jsx) is a single cross-cutting admin surface for categories/subjects/skills/badges — don't duplicate it on the Badges tab.

A fourth tab — **Yearbook** — sits inside the Atlas hub: lifelong chronological chapter timeline with `ChapterCard` variants (current/past/future), `TimelineEntry` with kind-iconed rows, `EntryDetailSheet` (BottomSheet), and `ManualEntryFormModal` for the parent-only add-memory flow.

### Skills page ([`pages/Achievements.jsx`](/frontend/src/pages/Achievements.jsx), "Illuminated Atlas")

A **tome shelf opening onto an illuminated folio** — designed to speak the same manuscript language as its Atlas siblings. [`SkillTreeView`](/frontend/src/pages/achievements/SkillTreeView.jsx) is a thin orchestrator: [`TomeShelf`](/frontend/src/pages/achievements/TomeShelf.jsx) + [`TomeSpine`](/frontend/src/pages/achievements/TomeSpine.jsx) above [`FolioSpread`](/frontend/src/pages/achievements/FolioSpread.jsx).

**TomeShelf** is a horizontal snap-scroll rail with `role="tablist"` + arrow-key nav + `scrollIntoView` on active change (same contract as the old CategoryRibbon). **TomeSpine** renders each SkillCategory as a bound book: icon medallion at the head cap, vertical display-serif name running up the spine (14px, `writing-mode: vertical-rl` + `transform: rotate(180deg)`), a bookmark ribbon in sheikah-teal that unfurls on select, an L# chip near the foot, and a gilt foot-band whose fill width/color is keyed to `tierForProgress` for category progress. The chip + band live **inside** the flex column (icon → `flex-1` title → chip → band) so a long vertical title like "Woodworking" can never overflow into the chip zone regardless of category name length.

**FolioSpread** renders the active category as a two-page parchment spread on desktop (`md:grid-cols-[220px_1fr]`, gutter shadow down the middle) collapsing to single-column on mobile. The verso (left page) is the category incipit: a huge gilt drop-capital rendered by [`IlluminatedVersal`](/frontend/src/components/atlas/IlluminatedVersal.jsx), script kicker, level strap, and a progress bar. The recto (right page) lists subjects as [`ChapterRubric`](/frontend/src/components/atlas/ChapterRubric.jsx) headers (§I / §II drop-caps, not sticky) followed by [`SkillVerse`](/frontend/src/pages/achievements/SkillVerse.jsx) rows.

**SkillVerse** is an illuminated row: `IlluminatedVersal` drop-cap (the skill's first letter) filling bottom-up with gilt as XP accrues + wearing a `RARITY_HALO[tier]` glow at cresting/gilded tiers, the skill name + level name + inline [`PrereqChain`](/frontend/src/pages/achievements/PrereqChain.jsx), and a right-aligned L# strap with a thin gilt hairline encoding progress to next level. [`SkillDetailSheet`](/frontend/src/pages/achievements/SkillDetailSheet.jsx) (via `BottomSheet`) also uses `IlluminatedVersal` at `size="xl"` with the halo.

Parent View|Manage toggle in the header routes to [`ManagePanel`](/frontend/src/pages/achievements/ManagePanel.jsx).

### Badges page ([`pages/Badges.jsx`](/frontend/src/pages/Badges.jsx), "Sigil Case — Reliquary Codex")

View-only illuminated codex that groups badges into seven criterion-family chapters (Chronos · Ventures · Mastery · Coffers · Scholar · Adventure · Reliquary), mirroring how [`apps/achievements/criteria.py`](/apps/achievements/criteria.py) already buckets criterion types by subsystem.

- [`SigilCodex`](/frontend/src/pages/achievements/SigilCodex.jsx) orchestrates — an [`IncipitBand`](/frontend/src/components/atlas/IncipitBand.jsx) hero above seven [`CollectionFolio`](/frontend/src/pages/achievements/CollectionFolio.jsx) sections.
- [`collections.constants.js`](/frontend/src/pages/achievements/collections.constants.js) owns the taxonomy: `COLLECTIONS` array (id/rubric/letter/name/kicker/criteria), `collectionForCriterion` (falls back to `reliquary` for unknowns so new backend criteria never render as "undefined"), `groupBadgesByCollection`, `rarityCounts`, `unlockHint` (plain-English template for every known criterion_type; falls back to `badge.description` for unknowns), `ladderSiblings` (same-criterion_type progressions for the detail sheet).
- Each folio is a `<section aria-labelledby>` with a rubric numeral (§I–§VII), an `IlluminatedVersal` drop-cap whose gilt fills with chapter progress, a slim [`RarityStrand`](/frontend/src/components/atlas/RarityStrand.jsx) (5-segment distribution band sized by per-rarity totals, inner fill by earned/total), and the 2/3/4/5-col sigil grid. Empty chapters still render the header + "no seals yet in this chapter" whisper so the codex skeleton reads consistently for fresh users.
- [`BadgeSigil`](/frontend/src/components/atlas/BadgeSigil.jsx): earned sigils keep `RARITY_HALO` + foil sheen + `animate-gilded-glint` for recents (≤ 7d via `isRecentlyEarned`) and now show a `+{xp_bonus} XP` gilt ledge. Unearned sigils render as **debossed intaglios** — pressed ring with inset shadow, grayscaled icon, and a single-line font-script `unlockHint(badge)` line beneath the name. `aria-label` still ends in `· not yet earned`.
- [`BadgeDetailSheet`](/frontend/src/pages/achievements/BadgeDetailSheet.jsx) accepts `allBadges` + `earnedIds` so it can render (a) a `"from the reliquary of {chapter} · §N"` script chip, (b) a "to earn" / "you earned this by" unlock card with the plain-English hint, and (c) a ladder strip of Tier I/II/III rungs when 2+ badges share a criterion_type (current rung highlighted; earned siblings styled moss; later rungs dashed + muted). Pass-through from `Badges.jsx` via `useMemo`'d `earnedIds` Set.
- **Hint-vs-description dedupe**: the detail sheet suppresses the hint card when `unlockHint(badge)` falls back to `badge.description`, so the same prose doesn't render twice (description already sits under the rarity ribbon). Sigil tiles are unaffected — they never show the description, so the hint always renders on unearned tiles.
- **Accessibility**: every folio exposes `role=region` via `<section aria-labelledby>`; `RarityStrand` carries `role="img"` with a descriptive aria-label ("4 of 21 sealed — 2 of 7 common, 1 of 6 uncommon, …"). All gilt / flourish / glint effects sit inside the existing `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` rules in [`index.css`](/frontend/src/index.css).
- No backend changes — reads `/api/achievements/summary/` + `/api/badges/` exactly as the old flat grid did. The retired `BadgeSigilGrid.jsx` is gone; `SigilCodex` is the only consumer in the tree.

### Sketchbook page ([`pages/Portfolio.jsx`](/frontend/src/pages/Portfolio.jsx))

Flattens the `/api/portfolio/` response (`{projects, homework}`) into one unified item list, then re-groups based on the active mode. Toolbar: four filter pills (`All` / `Projects` / `Homework` / `Timelapses`) with live counts + a `By project` / `By date` sort toggle. By-date groups by `"MMMM YYYY"` (newest first). Each tile is a `<button>` — click opens an inline lightbox (fixed overlay at `z-50`, prev/next `IconButton`s, click-backdrop-to-close) scoped to the current filtered/ordered set.

- **Audio playback** (2026-05): when the active tile is a Creation that carries an `audio` attachment, the lightbox renders an `<audio controls>` next to the image — fix for the upload-but-never-playback latent bug.
- Trash icon in the top-right corner is gated by `canDelete = user.role === 'parent' || item.ownerId === user.id` and routes through [`ConfirmDialog`](/frontend/src/components/ConfirmDialog.jsx) (`role="alertdialog"`, "Remove" label).
- Delete endpoints: `DELETE /api/photos/{id}/` for project photos (permissioned `destroy` on [`ProjectPhotoViewSet`](/apps/portfolio/views.py) — owner or parent; both the row AND the storage blob go), `DELETE /api/homework-proofs/{id}/` for proofs (new [`HomeworkProofViewSet`](/apps/homework/views.py) — destroy-only; the parent `HomeworkSubmission` stays so approval history remains intact).
- The [`PortfolioView`](/apps/portfolio/views.py) response includes `user` on each photo and `user_id` on each homework item so the frontend can gate `canDelete` without an extra lookup.

## Character page / Frontispiece (`/sigil`, route redirected from `/character`, 2026-04-22 redesign)

The inside-cover plate of the journal — personal author-portrait rather than a dashboard. Architecture in [`pages/character/`](/frontend/src/pages/character/):

- [`SigilFrontispiece.jsx`](/frontend/src/pages/character/SigilFrontispiece.jsx) — hero incipit with an oversized `IlluminatedVersal` of the user's initial (gilt fills with level %), display-name in italic serif, active title as a script chip, the **Trophy Seal** on the recto, and three `StreakGlyph` vital pips beneath (current streak with animated `StreakFlame`, perfect days, best streak).
- [`TrophySlot.jsx`](/frontend/src/pages/character/TrophySlot.jsx) + [`TrophyBadgePicker.jsx`](/frontend/src/pages/character/TrophyBadgePicker.jsx) — empty slot is a debossed intaglio ("choose from your reliquary"); filled slot wears full `RARITY_HALO`. Picker is a `BottomSheet` that passes earned badges through `groupBadgesByCollection` — clicking a seal sets the trophy; clicking the current trophy clears it (null payload).
- Four [`CosmeticChapter.jsx`](/frontend/src/pages/character/CosmeticChapter.jsx) folios mirror `CollectionFolio`: rubric numeral + drop-cap + rarity strand + sigil grid. Each tile is a [`CosmeticSigil.jsx`](/frontend/src/pages/character/CosmeticSigil.jsx) in one of three states — **equipped** (halo + "equipped" gilt ribbon), **owned** (clean rarity-ringed tile), or **locked** (debossed intaglio + script unlock hint derived from `item.description` or a rarity-flavored fallback). Locked tiles render as `role="img"` with "not yet owned" in the aria-label — not clickable, so they don't accept focus or trigger equip.
- **Live theme preview**: hovering a cosmetic in the Journal Covers chapter calls `applyTheme(metadata.theme)` transiently so the whole page skin previews in real time. `mouseleave` / `blur` restores the user's current theme. Guarded by `matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')` — reduced-motion users never see the flash.
- Per-area shared logic lives in [`character.constants.js`](/frontend/src/pages/character/character.constants.js) — `COSMETIC_CHAPTERS` (slot → rubric/letter/name/kicker), `STREAK_TIERS` + `streakTier(days)` (flame sizing ladder aligned with backend milestone thresholds 1/7/30/100), `mergeSlotCosmetics(slot, owned, catalog, activeId)` (dedupe + sort: equipped → owned → locked, each sub-sorted by rarity then name), `slotRarityCounts` (feeds the strand), `cosmeticLockHint` (description-or-rarity-flavored fallback).
- [`Character.jsx`](/frontend/src/pages/Character.jsx) is a thin orchestrator: parallel fetches via `useApi` for `getCharacterProfile` + `getCosmetics` + `getCosmeticCatalog` + `getBadges` + `getAchievementsSummary`, with `useMemo`'d `allBadges`/`earnedBadges` passed to the picker. Equip/unequip + trophy-set all optimistically mutate via `refresh()` without a full page reload.

## Dashboard (role-split)

[`pages/Dashboard.jsx`](/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx) is a thin router — loads `/api/dashboard/` once and branches to `ChildDashboard` or `ParentDashboard` based on `user.role`. The shared loader + error-retry block lives at this layer so integration tests can exercise both roles from one entry point.

- **Child** body: contextual `HeroPrimaryCard` (priority `clocked → next-action → quest-progress → idle`, where `next-action` consumes `next_actions[0]` from the backend's [`apps/projects/priority.py`](/apps/projects/priority.py) scorer), horizontal `VitalPipStrip` (coins/streak/level/pet), quest log (duties/homework/rituals entries with "to be inked before nightfall" kicker merged into the page header — no separate "Today's Log" section header), loot rail, and everything else wrapped in `AccordionSection` (collapsed by default, open state persisted per-title in `localStorage` keyed `dashboard-accordion-{slug}`). **Since-last-visit card** (2026-06): the dashboard payload's child-only `since_last_visit` block (`{last_seen_at, badges_earned, coins_earned, approvals}`, `null` on first visit — backed by `User.last_seen_at`, stamped on every dashboard fetch) renders as a dismissible [`SinceLastVisitCard`](/frontend/src/components/dashboard/SinceLastVisitCard.jsx) above the `VitalPipStrip`; it hides itself when every count is zero, so quick refreshes show nothing.
- **Parent** body: `useParentDashboard` hook aggregates pending chores + pending homework submissions + pending redemptions + pending creations + pending **exchange requests** (added 2026-05 via `getExchangeList`) in parallel via `Promise.allSettled`, unifies to `{ id, kind, kidId, kidName, title, subtitle, reward, submittedAt }`, sorts newest-first; `ApprovalQueueList` groups by kid with inline Approve/Reject rows that call the existing `approveChoreCompletion` / `approveHomeworkSubmission` / `approveRedemption` / `approveCreation` / `approveExchange` endpoints and optimistically remove the row. **Approve all (N)** (2026-05): when a kid has 2+ approvable rows pending, a per-kid `Approve all (N)` button appears; the fanout uses `Promise.allSettled` so a single 4xx doesn't kill the batch (failures stay visible with an error chip). Bulk runs greater than 3 rows prompt a `ConfirmDialog` first. **Reject sheet** (2026-05): the inline Reject button now opens a `BottomSheet` with an optional note input — the note is woven into the rejection-notification body (visible per the chore/homework/creation/redemption/exchange notification types) so the kid sees why without having to ask. **Empty state** (2026-05): the dashboard payload's `_parent_extras` now includes `children_count`; `ParentDashboard` renders a `NoChildrenWelcome` card linking to `/manage` when `children_count === 0` instead of an empty queue. **Child picker on Payments adjust** (2026-05): the parent-only `Adjust Payment` form on `/payments` swapped its raw "Child User ID" number input for a `<SelectField>` populated by `getChildren()` — eliminates typo-driven 404s. **Partial-failure visibility** (2026-05-09): the hook also returns `failedSources` (string labels — `chore approvals`, `homework approvals`, `reward redemptions`, etc., one per `SOURCES` entry in [`useParentDashboard.js`](/frontend/src/hooks/useParentDashboard.js)). `ParentDashboard.jsx` renders an `<ErrorAlert>` + Retry button above the queue when any fetch errored, so a 500 on (say) `/api/homework/dashboard/` is no longer indistinguishable from "no pending homework approvals" — pinned by the "shows a retry-able banner when an approval queue fails to load" case in [`ParentDashboard.test.jsx`](/frontend/src/pages/ParentDashboard.test.jsx). Today's Log is retired for parents. Collapsed `Week at a glance` + `Quick adjusts` blocks round out the page. **Week at a glance is live** (2026-06): `_parent_extras` now returns `this_week_by_kid` (`[{kid_id, name, hours, earnings}]` — completed `TimeEntry` minutes × the child's `hourly_rate`, family-scoped via `children_in`), so `WeekGlanceBlock` and the Family Snapshot per-kid lines render real data instead of the perpetual empty state.

## Global header + FAB

`JournalShell` wraps avatar (mobile) + `HeaderStatusPips` (middle, role-aware) + `NotificationBell` (right) in a `sticky top-0 z-30` container that also includes the `HeaderProgressBand` — a 2–3px full-width band that's inert by default and renders a sheikah-teal gradient scaled to `getActiveQuest().progress_percent` when a quest is active. The sticky container has a `bg-ink-page` backdrop so page content doesn't bleed through on scroll.

**Gotcha:** the mobile `overflow-x: hidden` guard lives on `body` (not `main`) in `index.css` — putting it on `main` turns `<main>` into a scroll container which traps `position: sticky` inside the main's overflow instead of the window.

**Quest log on the child dashboard** is now driven entirely by `next_actions` from the dashboard payload — `buildQuestLogFromActions()` in [`ChildDashboard.jsx`](/frontend/src/pages/ChildDashboard.jsx) buckets the scored, sorted feed into Study (homework) / Duty (chore) / Ritual (habit) sections. Backend ordering (overdue → due-today → due-tomorrow → daily chore → due-this-week → weekly chore — see scoring formula in [`apps/projects/priority.py`](/apps/projects/priority.py)) is preserved within each section. Submitted-pending homework is excluded server-side ("nothing left to *do*"); rejected submissions remain eligible. Clicking an open homework row opens [`HomeworkSubmitSheet`](/frontend/src/components/HomeworkSubmitSheet.jsx) inline (photo upload + notes + `submitHomework`) so the child can file proof without leaving the dashboard — the same component is reused on [`pages/Homework/index.jsx`](/frontend/src/pages/Homework/index.jsx).

`QuickActionsFab` replaces the old `ClockFab` — single bottom-right button that opens `QuickActionsSheet` with role-aware contextual actions: child sees Clock in · Add homework · Submit due (only when a due assignment exists) · Start a quest (only when a quest scroll is in inventory) · Contribute to hoard (only when an active savings goal exists); parent sees Clock in · Create homework for a kid · Adjust coins · Adjust payment. Reward shop is deliberately **not** in quick actions — browsing rewards is a considered choice and belongs on the Treasury page. Clock-in is still the most common action and is the default focus when opened. The FAB continues to show a running-timer chip while clocked in so the at-a-glance signal is preserved.

## Notifications constants parity

[`components/NotificationBell.jsx`](/frontend/src/components/NotificationBell.jsx) renders a type-specific lucide icon and falls back to a sensible default route when the backend `link` field is empty, via the `NOTIFICATION_TYPE_META` map in [`components/notifications.constants.js`](/frontend/src/components/notifications.constants.js) (`{icon, accent, route}` per type — e.g. `badge_earned` → Award icon, gold accent, `/atlas?tab=badges`). The default route is the safety net: notifiers that forget to set `link` still navigate to a relevant page rather than no-op'ing the click.

**Parity gate**: [`notifications.constants.test.js`](/frontend/src/components/notifications.constants.test.js) hardcodes the backend `NotificationType` enum; the test fails CI when a new value lands on the backend without an entry here, so the bell can't silently degrade to the generic Bell + no-route fallback. Unknown types still fall back gracefully to `BellRing` + null route — but the parity test is what makes that a fail-loud rather than fail-silent path.

## Avatars

`accounts.User.avatar` ImageField → `upload_to="avatars/"`. Self-uploaded on the Settings page Profile card — hidden `<input type="file">` triggered by a "Upload/Change avatar" `<Button>`, optionally paired with a "Remove" button that opens `ConfirmDialog` and sends `PATCH /api/auth/me/ {avatar: ""}`. Upload path runs the file through [`downscaleImage`](/frontend/src/utils/image.js) (`maxDim: 512`) before sending multipart. [`MeView.patch`](/apps/projects/views.py) accepts both multipart + JSON via `parser_classes = [MultiPartParser, FormParser, JSONParser]` — a new file replaces the old via `user.avatar.delete(save=False)` → new assign, empty-string sentinel clears without assigning. [`AvatarMenu`](/frontend/src/components/AvatarMenu.jsx) renders `<img src={user.avatar}>` when set, falls back to the display-name initial otherwise. [`AuthProvider`](/frontend/src/hooks/useApi.js) exposes `setUser` so `SettingsPage` can refresh context in place after upload — no second `/auth/me/` roundtrip needed.
